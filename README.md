# FortranThermoStats
This is a Fortran 90 program that allows one to read a molecule file (```input.f90```, in this case, is the water molecule) and calculate and print all the thermodynamic information of the molecule.

This script is part of my duty to accomplish the Theoretical Chemistry Exams at University of Florence in 2017.

To see the theory behind it, in the ```variae``` folder there is the pdf ```thermo.pdf``` written by Joseph W. Ochterski which explains the Thermochemistry in Gaussian program, from which my program is inspired. In the above mentioned folder there are also the files of the water optimization and frequency calcolation in Gaussian90 (```water_opt_freq.gau``` is the input, ```water_opt_freq.log``` is the output).
